## Pros

- Does not mask author and owner of original repository
- Easy to origanise as is essentially just a web document
- End user can download the code that is of interest, instead of downloading everything

## Cons

- Personally I don't see many downsides with this approach, except that it could just as easily been done anywhere else than on github. Essentially github just becomes a webhosting site.
